- Caching objects
  - Probably best to do this in api.get_X
  - Cache likely needs to be checked in parameters
  - Use a dict like:   
      cache = {'eu' : {'realms' : {'draenor' : {'realm' : Realm(), 'chars' : {'Untamesbush' : Character(), 'Kegger' : Character()},}}
  - Sometimes data is regenerated for every call (when custom dicts are made), not perfect
  
- Maybe only ever fetch one field at a time? Once I have titles, can I drop them and use dict.update()?

- Consider using dict.get instead of try: except KeyError

- May need to clone a lot of structures for immutability if necessary

- Consider using dict.get instead of try: except KeyError (don't think this is reasonable usually)

- Character.can_use_item() would be cool!

- Wowhead &power exposes data well (e.g. http://www.wowhead.com/spell=580&power)

- Sphinx or similar for docs would be nice

- Rating conversion calculators?

- MutableItem(wowthon.Item) could be a good idea. Items can be cached then.
