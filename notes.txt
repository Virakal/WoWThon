- Have Item() act as a factory for a bunch of subclasses? Might end up weird.
- Probably not worth it. Can introspect with dir() or rely on item type field.

- Caching objects
  - Probably best to do this in constructors
  - Cache likely needs to be checked in parameters
  - Use a dict like:   
        cache = {'eu' : {'realms' : {'draenor' : {'realm' : Realm(), 'chars' : {'Untamesbush' : Character(), 'Kegger' : Character()},}}

- Maybe only ever fetch one field at a time? Once I have titles, can I drop them and use dict.update()?

- Item will probably need reforge() mutator
