- Caching objects
  - Probably best to do this in constructors
  - Cache likely needs to be checked in parameters
  - Use a dict like:   
        cache = {'eu' : {'realms' : {'draenor' : {'realm' : Realm(), 'chars' : {'Untamesbush' : Character(), 'Kegger' : Character()},}}

- Maybe only ever fetch one field at a time? Once I have titles, can I drop them and use dict.update()?

- Item will probably need reforge() mutator

- Consider using dict.get instead of try: except KeyError

- May need to clone a lot of structures for immutability if necessary

- Consider using dict.get instead of try: except KeyError (don't think this is reasonable usually)

- Error messages for non-existent players, etc. are delayed!
