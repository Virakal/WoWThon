- Cache using dbm when last_modified checking is done? (No noticable speed boost on auctions with dbm.dumb)

- Sometimes data is regenerated for every call (when custom dicts are made), not perfect

- Maybe only ever fetch one field at a time? Once I have titles, can I drop them and use dict.update()?

- May need to clone a lot of structures for immutability if necessary

- Character.can_use_item() would be cool!

- Wowhead &power exposes data well (e.g. http://www.wowhead.com/spell=580&power)

- Sphinx or similar for docs would be nice

- Rating conversion calculators?

- MutableItem(wowthon.Item) could be a good idea. Items can be cached then.

- Modified-Since headers?

- Considering moving the constants to API methods, or moving the
  API's static methods out in to the wowthon package

- Iterable arena ladders would rock
